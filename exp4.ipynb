      "The approach in the paper focuses on utilizing a robust maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference to reconstruct 3D edges of wiry structures from monocular image sequences. It employs a representation based on straight edges constructed from points, generating sparse 3D points and subsequently constructing 3D edge candidates. Bayesian inference is used to update the beliefs of these edge candidates, with a post-processing step applied to filter out false edges. The experimental validation demonstrates the superior performance of this framework in reconstructing 3D edges of wiry structures compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The method efficiently addresses challenges such as severe self-occlusion and lack of texture commonly found in wiry objects, showcasing its potential for robotic manipulation tasks.\n",

      "The first paper focuses on utilizing vision foundation models to extract semantic information from RGB images to enhance 3D representations of cloth-like deformable objects. It evaluates the effectiveness of models like Grounded SAM and DINOv2 in tasks such as semantic segmentation and dense feature extraction for cloth manipulation. The study highlights challenges in accurately tracking keypoints and representing deformable cloth objects, suggesting potential directions for future research to improve dense descriptors for keypoint tracking on deformable objects. The paper also discusses the limitations of current models when dealing with deformable objects and proposes the use of structural priors, like graph-based methods, to enhance model performance, especially for out-of-distribution objects like textureless cloth.\n",

      "The second paper's approach focuses on acquiring rich object models to support high-level task execution in unstructured environments by sequentially fusing prior knowledge from pre-trained foundation models with raw point clouds acquired online. It involves leveraging pre-trained VLMs for object masks, incorporating depth priors for accurate object geometries, and locally building maps for object extraction and placement. The pipeline includes stages for semantic mask extraction, model refinement using depth priors, and 3D object model extraction. Classical methods like ICP are utilized for scene reconstruction and local scene updates post-action execution. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating accurate 3D object models compared to alternate methods, showcasing improvements in object modeling accuracy and rapid scene reconstruction capabilities.\n",
